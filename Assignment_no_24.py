"""1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?
Ans - def statemnts and lambda expression both are the functions while def statements are not single line functions and it
contain list whie lambda expression are single line with no return statements.

2. What is the benefit of lambda?
Ans- One line functions. We use them to create anonymous functions.The code is simple and clear.No additional
variables are added.

3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.
Ans - Map operation takes a mapping function and a vector of data as arguments and returns a new vector, which is the result of
applying the mapping function on each element of the vector independently.
The filter function operates on a list and returns a subset of that list after applying the filtering rule.
The reduce function will transform a given list into a single value by applying a given function continuously
to all the elements.

4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?
Ans - Function annotations are arbitrary python expressions that are associated with various part of functions. Function
annotations provide a way of associating various parts of a function with arbitrary python expressions at compile time.

5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?
Ans - A recursive function is a function in code that refers to itself for execution. If we want to call same function
within the function then we will use recursive functions

6. What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?
Ans - Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters
    Use of regular and updated comments are valuable to both the coders and users.
    Use of trailing commas
    Use Python’s default UTF-8 or ASCII encodings and not any fancy encodings
    Follow Naming Conventions
    Name your classes and functions consistently

7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.
Ans - Using Call by Value and Call by Reference.
