    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "Ans - Two Values - True and False . We require to write T and F in Capital\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "Ans - Different Types - and , or and not \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the \n",
    "operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "Ans - and Combination :\n",
    "    True and True --- True\n",
    "    True and False -- False\n",
    "    False and True --- False\n",

    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "Ans . Assignement operator used to assign any value to variable while equal to operator used to check condition.\n",
    "eg. a=10 -- here we are assigning value 10 to variable a \n",

    "Ans- Go to the Kernel and then click on restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "Ans - Break -- break directly break the loop and come outside. While continue will again go to start at loop and start working.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "Ans - There is no any difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)\n",
