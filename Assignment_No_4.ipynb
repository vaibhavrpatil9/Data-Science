    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "Ans - This is a square bracket and we use this for list assignment and getting index of any item . \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? \n",
    "(Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - spam[2]='hello'\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "Ans- 'd' \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "Ans - 'd'\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the value of spam[:2]?\n",
    "Ans - ['a','b']\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "Ans - 1\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "Ans - It append 99 at the last position and list will look like -- [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True,99]\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "Ans - It will remove the first ocurance of 'cat' and liks will look like - [3.14, 11, 'cat,' True,99]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "Ans - IN list concatenation we will add the new list in existing list from its last element.\n",
    "e.g. l1=[1,2,3] and l2=[3,5,6] then l1 +l2 = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6] \n",
    "In list replication we can replicate same list for as per our requirements.\n",
    "e.g.  l1=[1,2,3] , l1*2 = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "Ans - In list.append() we add new element as the last position while in list.insert() we can add element at any index \n",
    "position as per our requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Ans - list.pop() and list.remove()\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "Ans - Both list and string are iterable and we can perform indexing and slicing operation with both.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Ans- List are mutable while tuples are immutable. We use [] for list assignment while we use  () for tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "Ans - t1=(42,) \n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "Ans - convert list into tuples -- tuple(list1) and convert tuple into list -- list(tuple1)\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "Ans - They contain  references to list values.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "Ans - copy() create reference to original object. If you change copied object - you change the original object.\n",
    "deepcopy() creates new object and does real copying of original object to new one. Changing new deepcopied object \n",
    "doesn't affect original object.\n"
